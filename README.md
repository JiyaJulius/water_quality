In this study, we explore the use of machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier, to automate the analysis of water quality based on parameters such as turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity and temperature. A dataset from Brisbane, Australia, was used to predict dissolved oxygen levels and evaluate the importance of various water quality parameters.
